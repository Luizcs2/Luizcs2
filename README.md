🚀 Just getting started with coding—currently diving into React and Java.

💡 Learning as I go (mostly by Googling my own mistakes).

🛠️ Right now, I’m working on:

Not losing my patience while debugging 🐛
Some fun beginner projects (open to suggestions!)
🎯 Goals:

Write code that actually works on the first try 🤞
Build something useful (or at least fun)
☕ Fun fact: I swear my code runs better after coffee.
