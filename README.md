👋 Hey there! I'm Luiz

🚀 Just launched into the world of coding and currently exploring the wonders of React and java 

💡 Learning one bug at a time, mostly by Googling my own errors.

🛠️ Currently working on:

My patience when debugging 🐛
Cool beginner projects (suggestions welcome!)
🎯 Goals:
Write code that actually works on the first try 🤞
Build something people find useful (or at least fun!)
☕ Fun fact: My code runs better after coffee... or at least I think it does.

Let's connect! I'm always up for learning and collaborating.
